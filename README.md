# Bookstore with React (Garan Academy)
This is the Project for Garan Academy. Using [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Required
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)

## Installation
The tool will create and initialize environment and dependencies automatically.

`$ yarn create react-app antd-demo`

And you will get `antd-demo` folder. You can rename your `antd-demo` whatever you want. (In this case I renamed `antd-demo` to `Bookstore`)

Then we go inside `Bookstore` and start it.
```
$ cd Bookstore
$ yarn start
```
